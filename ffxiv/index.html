        <h3>Roles</h3>
        <p>
          FFXIV jobs are broken down into three main roles, each of which has different jobs within an instance: Tanks, Healers, and DPS
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tanks:</strong> A tank's job is to gain Enmity and get hit by enemies so that their buddies don't die. As a tank, you're the one pulling groups of enemies ("trash packs") and getting slapped around by the boss. If I could ask every tank to remember five things, they would be the following:
            <ul>
              <li><em>Make sure that tank stance is on!</em> Each tank class has an ability that allows them to generate extra enmity, and whoever has the most enmity is the person that enemies are gonna start attacking. You'll start dropping aggro REAL quick if this is off, and it is OFF BY DEFAULT whenever you load into an instance!</li>
              <li><em>You are not immune to AOEs!</em> If the ground lights up, I don't care how much HP you've got or how many damage mitigation cooldowns you've popped, MOVE. There are one-shot AOEs later in the game, and it's good to get in the habit now.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
