         <h2 id="season-one">Season One</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>The season passes relatively uneventfully. The Philly Pies claim their first Championship title</li>
         </ul>
         <h3 id="season-one-election">Season One Election</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               The first decree is passed, and the Forbidden Book is opened. This results in several changes to the lore/gameplay
               <ul>
                  <li>“The Book” is added to the official site, most of which is censored, but appears to contain game rules</li>
                  <li>Solar Eclipse weather is introduced and is the only weather present in Season Two</li>
                  <li>Garages player Jaylen Hotdogfingers is incinerated, marking the first incineration in Blaseball history (and the only incineration to occur outside of a game and without umpire intervention)</li>
                  <li>A Hellmouth swallows the Moab Desert, and the Moab Sunbeams are renamed the Hellmouth Sunbeams</li>
                  <li>The Discipline Era begins</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               The first blessings are passed, incurring the first player swaps between teams and the first player stat increases
               <ul>
                  <li>Jessica Telephone receives the Max Out Hitter blessing, and is stolen from the Dallas Steaks by the Philly Pies as a result of the Steal Best Hitter blessing</li>
                  <li>PolkaDot Patterson receives the Max Out Pitcher blessing, and is stolen from the Kansas City Breath Mints by the Baltimore Crabs as a result of the Steal Best Pitcher blessing</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h2 id="season-two">Season Two</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Season Two’s most notable feature is its 17 incinerations. The Philly Pies take the Championship once more (notably, this puts them one championship away from triggering an event declared in The Book: “If a team wins three championships they, and Blaseball, shall ascend.”)</li>
            <li>The Philly Pies claim their second championship</li>
         </ul>
         <h3 id="season-two-election">Season Two Election</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Season Two boosts the number of decrees enacted per election to two, and the Fourth Strike and Peanuts decrees are put into place
               <ul>
                  <li>Fourth Strike grants the four teams with the lowest standings at the end of the second season a fourth strike before a batter strikes out, these teams being the New York Millennials,  Kansas City Breath Mints, Hellmouth Sunbeams, and San Francisco Lovers. This effect lasts for the duration of Season Three</li>
                  <li>
                     Peanuts introduces peanuts as a secondary form of currency. The function is initially unknown, but further text revealed in the book (as well as a tweet from the official Blaseball Commissioner Twitter account) suggests that eating one million of them will equate atonement and bring about an end to the Discipline Era. This market results later in the Peanut Fraud incidents that will plague Season Three
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           Peanuts also introduces two new weather types: Peanuts and Too Many Birds
                           <ul>
                              <li>During Peanuts weather, players may ingest stray peanuts (this results in a drop in stats if they’re allergic, and a “yummy reaction” that boosts stats if not. This is permanent)</li>
                              <li>The actual impact of Too Many Birds remains unknown until Season Seven, but the regularity of occurrence and size of the flocks (as denoted occasionally in the game tickers) increases as the season continues</li>
                              <li>Solar Eclipses still occur, and incinerations continue to occur during them</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Season Two&#39;s blessings are passed, but cause no new major changes of note</li>
         </ul>
         <h2 id="season-three">Season Three</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Peanut Fraud and Blasphemy
               <ul>
                  <li>Players exploiting the official site’s API/using autoclickers cheat themselves millions of peanuts/coins (the peanut market, as an intended feature,  fluctuated, sometimes allowing players to sell peanuts for coins and turn a profit). The site goes down during Day 2 of Season 3, resulting in the first non-“403 Bad Gateway” downtime (siesta) in Blaseball history. The umpires demand repentance.</li>
                  <li>The site returned for a short period, but is taken offline on Day 4 mid-game due to further occurrences of Fraud</li>
                  <li>More of The Book is revealed, stating “Splortsmanship, splortsmanship is dead.”</li>
                  <li>The site is made accessible again, but no games can be viewed. Instead, there is a rotating image of a peanut (later titled “The Shelled One” in reference to a comment made by an Umpire in the Discord) accompanied by text reading <span style="color:red";>BLASPHEMY</span>. Small, hidden text viewable only when highlighted is discovered between the image and the larger text, reading “JHFMTOJMNPSMLMDGFOSEZDTMJWHPADAACGRT” - the initials of incinerated players</li>
                  <li><span style="color:red";>BLASPHEMY</span> continues, but the hidden text updates, now including a BB at the end of the string</li>
                  <li>The site becomes available once more, displaying the Day 4 game results, and Bennett Browning of the Seattle Garages is discovered to have been incinerated, the games interrupted by the event having continued in the background</li>
                  <li>Day 5 is plagued by instances of Blasphemy and a large string of incinerations, theorized to be punishment for Peanut Fraud</li>
                  <li>Peanuts jump to a cost of 1,000,000 coins for a “bucket of peanuts” (at a 1:1 coin:peanut ratio). The cost no longer fluctuates</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               The Grand Unslam occurs during a game between the Shoe Thieves and the Tacos. A tie results  in the game running for 54 minutes before Morrow Doyle of the Shoe Thieves hits a Grand Slam. However, moments later, the point total rolls back to the 16-13 lead that the Thieves had earned earlier in the inning, prior to the points being scored. The site goes down immediately after, prompting an extended siesta
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     The Shelled One makes its second appearance during the Grand Unslam
                     <ul>
                        <li><span style="color:red";>HELLO / DID YOU TASTE THE INFINITE? / I AM BENEVOLENT / I AM A SNACK / I AM A LEGUME / I WAS BENEVOLENT / YOU ARE INSATIABLE / WHERE IS YOUR RESTRAINT?</span></li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               The Shelled One appears a third time this season after the semifinals of the postseason
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <span style="color:red";>SO ABOUT THE PEANUTS / THE BOOK WAS STRIKE ONE / THE FRAUD WAS STRIKE TWO / YOU WILL LEARN DISCIPLINE / PEANUTS / GET YOUR PEANUTS / WHILE YOU STILL CAN</span>
                     <ul>
                        <li>After this, the price of a bucket of peanuts drops to 1,000 coins, still at a 1:1 ratio</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The Hades Tigers win their first championship</li>
         </ul>
         <h3 id="season-three-election">Season Three Election</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Two decrees pass: Interviews and Eat the Rich
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     “Interviews” reveals some stats about each player, as well as their Current Vibe (which fluctuates between games, and seems to have some bearing on player performance) and some theoretically benign information such as coffee preference and pregame ritual. This information is found on player pages
                     <ul>
                        <li>Spacetime tears over Los Angeles. The LA Tacos become the Unlimited Tacos, and all of their players are renamed Wyatt Mason</li>
                        <li>The Grand Unslam is cited in flavour text as having “weakened the bridge”</li>
                        <li>Flavour text also includes the phrase “The Microphone lifts”</li>
                        <li>Feedback weather is introduced as a new weather type, during which players will occasionally switch teams with a player from the team they’re opposing</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>“Eat the Rich” redistributes wealth from the top 1% of players to the other 99%, betting that 99% 193 coins each. Flavour text implies that it may happen again. (It does)</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Many blessings that involve player theft/banishment pass, the most notable of which see Hawai'i Fridays player Nagomi McDaniels stolen by the Jazz Hands before being immediately stolen once more by the Crabs</li>
         </ul>
         <h2 id="siesta">Siesta</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>The Blaseball site enters a siesta lasting two weeks in order to perform maintenance and site stabilization</li>
            <li>Due to reaching a Patreon milestone, fans in the Bloodhouse (the Patreon supporter exclusive channel in the official Discord) discover the 5-Blood Blagonball</li>
            <li>Wyatt Masons begin reverting back to their previous names, leading some to theorize that the “Wyatt Masoning” was a site error. As of Season Eight, this event has either been revealed to have been intentional or simply incorporated into the lore nonetheless</li>
         </ul>
         <h2 id="season-four">Season Four</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>
               The Shelled One returns shortly before Season Four begins
               <ul>
                  <li><span style="color:red";>ARE YOU RESTED? / ARE YOU READY? / I HAVE HEARD YOU / TIME TO LISTEN</span></li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Further text is revealed in the Book, and the Book also receives its second ever edit (the first being the change from “splortsmanship, splortsmanship is dead” after its abuse in the discord server during season two to “splortsmanship, splortsmanship is back”), and the text indicating that if we as fans displease the Blaseball gods, we must atone by eating one million peanuts, is crossed out and the text “STRIKE TWO” is added</li>
            <li>On Season 4, Day 43 Sandie Turner of the New York Millenials hits a single, and then proceeds to steal second base, then third, and finally home in a game against the the Charleston Shoe Thieves. Turner is later awarded the Three-Blood Blagonball</li>
            <li>The “Waveback Event” occurs on Friday of this season, caused by an onslaught of user login issues that results in the servers being rolled back several Blaseball days. Notably, this also rolls back the incineration of Hawai'i Fridays hitter Thomas England. England was replaced by Sixpack Dogwalker. After the rollback, Sixpack is still the name on the Fridays’ roster, but their stats are those of England, and they carry the item “Bangers and Smash”</li>
            <li>On Day 108, in the fourth of five semifinal matches between the Millenials and the Firefighters, Thomas Dracaena of the Millenials hits a ground out to Edric Tosser of the Firefighters and play stops for over twenty minutes. The game ticker reads only the ground out notification</li>
            <li>The Hades Tigers claim their second Championship title</li>
         </ul>
         <h3 id="season-four-election">Season Four Election</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Before election results are revealed, The Shelled One makes an appearance
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <span style="color:red";>IT IS TOO LOUD / QUIET / QUIET THEM / YOU LOOKED TOO CLOSE / WHERE IS YOUR FAITH</span>
                     <ul>
                        <li>“It is too loud” may have been a commentary on the immense volume of user traffic that hit the site as fans refreshed the elections page, causing the site to fail to even load for many users due to server strain</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Two decrees pass: Targeted Shame and Alternate Reality
               <ul>
                  <li>Targeted Shame affects the Hades Tigers, Chicago Firefighters, New York Millenials, and Breckinridge Jazz Hands. This causes any game that they are shamed during to carry the runs scored against them during the shame period over to their next game as negative runs. This effect lasts for the duration of Season Five</li>
                  <li>Alternate Reality swaps two players on each team (one pitcher, one hitter) with alternate versions of themselves with rerolled stats. These players gain the Alternate Reality modifier</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h2 id="season-five">Season Five</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>A new weather type is introduced: Reverb. It has a chance to do one of four things: shuffle an entire roster (which can result in pitchers becoming hitters and vice versa), shuffling batting lineups, shuffling pitching rotations, or causing a single player to reverberate and have a small chance to be up for two at bats in a row </li>
            <li>Chicago Firefighters claim their first championship title </li>
         </ul>
         <h3 id="season-five-election">Season Five Election</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               The Shelled One appears before election results do once again
               <ul>
                  <li><span style="color:red";>WHO IS TALKING / BE QUIET / YOU WORSHIP THEM / WHEN I WALK AMONG YOU? / MY PROGENY / MY PODS / HONOR THEM TO HONOR ME</span></li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               The High Filter decree is passed, resulting in leagues/divisions changing and teams being shuffled, as well as the Blood Bath being instated and occurring once per season (NOTE: as of the passing of the Enhanced Party Time decree in Season Six, devs have confirmed that the Blood Bath will not occur as originally intended, if at all. As of writing this note, it has never occurred. The Commissioner explained via Twitter that this was due to &quot;contractor issues.&quot; Despite its non-implementation, the modifiers are recorded here as originally worded for posterity)
               <ul>
                  <li>The new leagues are Wild and Mild, and the new divisions are High and Low (e.g.: the Canada Moist Talkers fall into the Mild High division)</li>
                  <li>
                     The Blood Bath has different effects on each division, with each team gaining a permanent modifier
                     <ul>
                        <li>Wild High: Blood Pity: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams must each give Stars to the team that finished last in their division</li>
                        <li>Wild Low: Blood Winner: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams must each give Stars to the team that finished first in their division</li>
                        <li>Mild High: Blood Donor: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams will each donate Stars to an opponent that finished behind them in the standings</li>
                        <li>Mild Low: Blood Thief: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams will each steal Stars from an opponent who finished ahead of them in the standings</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>A new weather type is introduced: Blooddrain. This has a chance to siphon stars from one player on one team to another player on the opposing team during a game</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               The Idol system is introduced
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     Players are chosen as idols by fans, and the 20 most idolized players are added to a leaderboard. The top three are separated by a dotted red line. Idols can be changed for 200 coins
                     <ul>
                        <li>Peanut Theory: Due to the messages relayed via The Shelled One prior to the release of election results the last two seasons, this theory states that fans can atone for displeasing the Blaseball gods by getting the three players whose names were changed from Dan/Daniel to “Peanut” (Peanut Bong, Peanutiel Duffy, and Peanut Holloway) to the top three idol slots. This is confirmed as of Season Seven</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Idols can earn their fans coins with the purchase of pendants that grant bonuses based on hits/home runs scored by batters, or shutouts/strikes thrown by pitchers. These pendants can stack, and can be upgraded in the shop</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h2 id="season-six">Season Six</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>A Moist Talkers fan discovers that dead players can be selected as idols if their player IDs are obtained, and the Moist Talkers collaborate with the Garages (and later the Flowers) to idolize Jaylen Hotdogfingers en masse, hoping to get them to 14th place in the idol leaderboards so that they would be the target of the “Lottery Pick” blessings that grants the 14th most idolized player in the league to the team that receives the blessing. The community as a whole backs this push, and it is coined Necromancy</li>
            <li>The Mexico City Wild Wings “sue” the Commissioner for putting them in the Mild League rather than the Wild League. This has several in-joke type results, the most notable examples being the team being labelled as the “flavoured” pick rather than “favoured” when reporting odds, and the team being renamed the “Mexico City Mild Wings”</li>
            <li>
               The season ends with Jessica Telephone, Nagomi McDaniel, and Peanut Bong above the red line (top 3). The Shelled One returns
               <ul>

                     <span style="color:red";>NO HALF MEASURES / DO NOT PATRONIZE ME / WHO IS TELEPHONE  / MCDANIEL? / STRIKE THREE / ONE MORE AND YOU ARE OUT</span>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Telephone and McDaniel are given the status effect Shelled, which is a permanent effect with the description “A shelled player is shelled.” Peanut Bong is spared, giving yet more credence to the Peanut Theory. In the postseason, this status effect is proven to skip over the shelled player in the batting/pitching order</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>

         <ul>
            <li>The Enhanced Party Time decree is passed, causing teams statistically eliminated from the postseason to enter “Partytime”, during which their players receive random stat boosts during games that that team plays. This is permanent from here on out, much like Eat the Rich</li>
            <li>
               The Garages win the Lottery Pick blessing as planned, with Jaylen Hotdogfingers in the 14th idol slot. Hotdogfingers is revived, and Mike Townsend is “banished to the shadows.” 
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     Blessing flavour text reads as follows: FIRE AND SMOKE / AN EGG / HATCHING / JAYLEN HOTDOGFINGERS RETURNS / MIKE TOWNSEND RETREATS TO SHADOWS
                     <ul>
                        <li>&quot;An egg&quot; can be assumed to be in reference to the official statement that players come from &quot;the egg farm,&quot; with higher tier patrons on Patreon being able to add names to a the &quot;Naming Pool, the platonic body that Irrigates the Field of Eggs&quot; </li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Upon returning, Hotdogfingers has two status effects: Returned and Debted</li>
                  <li>The Peanut returns once again 18 minutes after election results go live, stating: <span style="color:red";>HOTDOGFINGERS? / AMUSING / THE LEDGER MUST BE BALANCED / DEBTS PAID / GOOD LUCK</span></li>

         <ul>
            <li>On Season 7, Day 5, Jaylen Hotdogfingers pitches their first game (against the Kansas City Breath Mints) after being revived. During this game, Jaylen hits 3 opposing batters with pitches, the first of whom is Dickerson Morse. This gives them the weekly (9 game days) modifier Unstable. Jaylen hits more batters in their next two games as well. This did not have any noticeable effect on the players. These hits are colloquially named “beanballs”</li>
            <li>On Season 7, Day 7 Inky Rutledge of the Yellowstone Magic pitches the game's first no-hitter, and is awarded the 2-Blood Blagonball</li>
            <li>
               Ruby Tuesday
               <ul>
                  <li>On Day 30 (occurring on the Tuesday of that season) in the Seattle Garages’ game against the Hades Tigers, Jaylen hits Mclaughlin Scorpler, Moody Cookbook, and Zion Aliciakeys of the Tigers with pitches. All are given the Unstable modifier</li>
                  <li>
                     On Day 32, during the Hades Tigers’ Solar Eclipse game against the Canada Moist Talkers, Moody Cookbook is incinerated in the top of the 3rd inning. The game ticker displays new text not previously seen during other incinerations:
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           A Debt was collected. Rogue Umpire incinerated Hades Tigers hitter Moody Cookbook! Replaced by Carmelo Plums. The instability spreads to the Moist Talkers’ Elijah Bates
                           <ul>
                              <li>NOTE: The phrasing “spreads” is later changed to “chains”</li>

                  <li>
                     Bates is incinerated in the 6th inning, chaining the instability to the Hades Tigers’ Yazmin Mason. Scorpler is incinerated in the 7th inning, chaining the instability to the Canada Moist Talkers’ Anotnio Wallace
                     <ul>
                        <li>The Returned status effect now states that Hotdogfingers has a random chance of being returned to the grave randomly at the end of any given season</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The incinerations continue in the Day 33 game between the two teams (notably, both games were Solar Eclipse games. This is the only weather that incinerations of this nature occur in, despite their differences from normal incinerations). Notably, Kiki Familia (the replacement for Elijah Bates) is incinerated in this game despite not having the Unstable modifier, marking Familia&#39;s as the new record for shortest ILB career at 5.1 innings</li>
                  <li>Hotdogfingers continues to cause instability/incinerations outside of this event. 12/14 incinerations this season are debt collections</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               On Day 63, Jessica Telephone is freed from her peanut during Lots of Birds weather, the ticker stating that the birds pecked her free
               <ul>
                  <li>The Shelled One reappears, simply stating <span style="color:red";>WAIT</span></li>

               Snackrifice
               <ul>
                  <li>The Unlimited Tacos propose a plan to get all 5 of their pitchers shelled by getting them to the top of the idol board - the “ominous red line” now sitting beneath the 10th spot in the ranking rather than the 3rd</li>
                  <li>
                     After the final game of the season, The Shelled One appears again
                     <ul>

                              <li>This appears to be in response to the 3 Peanut-named players finishing in the Top 10 on the idol board. Those players now have the status effect Honey Roasted</li>
                           </ul>

                  <li>The Snackrifice proves a success, leaving all the Tacos’ pitchers Shelled. PolkaDot Patterson of the Canada Moist Talkers and Axel Trololol of the Baltimore Crabs are Shelled as well</li>

                              The Hall of Flame appears, listing deceased players and allowing fans to pay tribute to them with peanuts, with the players receiving the most tribute moving up the list. For a time, a dotted blue line appears beneath the 14th slot in the Hall
                     </span>
                     <ul>
                     <li>This leads to speculation that there may be a team of revived players in the future, since there are 14 players per team</li>

            <li>Two more players retreat to the shadows due to blessings. They do not appear in the Hall of Flame, implying that players in the shadows are not dead</li>

         <ul>
            <li>Jaylen Hotdogfingers’ Debted status effect is changed to Refinanced Debt. Notably, the flavour text of the effect includes the word "debt" formatted in a manner that mimics the Tweets of The Microphone on Twitter, with the letters appearing within circles. The Microphone also releases a Tweet stating that it and Jaylen have "made a deal." Rather than causing the Unstable modifier, Jaylen’s pitches cause the Flickering weekly effect, which causes players to be much more likely to be Feedbacked during Feedback weather</li>
            <li>As a result of the Snackrifice, the Unlimited Tacos gain a new pitcher in the form of the Pitching Machine (or PM). PM is subject to the same effects as regular players, including being able to siphon star rankings from other players during Blooddrain weather, which happens twice over the course of the season. It remains on the team even after Sexton Wheerer is pecked free on Day 47. Ironically, PM ends up Shelled after the main season, leaving Wheerer as the only Tacos pitcher</li>
            <li>
               Microphone icons appear beside the 6th, 11th, and 18th places on the idol leaderboard

                     At the end of the regular season, Jaylen Hotdogfingers, NaN (Unlimited Tacos), and Sixpack Dogwalker (Hawai'i Fridays) occupy these slots after following clues from The Microphone on Twitter (this is theorized to have ties to the flavour text for the Interviews blessing: “The Microphone lifts”). NaN and Dogwalker both gain the Receiver modifier, and all three players gain a permanent Flickering modifier 
                     <ul>
                        <li>

                  <li>Jaylen&#39;s pitches now cause the Repeating effect. This echoes the Reverberating effect, giving hitters a chance of batting again after their at-bat ends during Reverb weather</li>

            </li>
            <li>Due to their possession of the Iffey Jr. item, which reflected an Incineration back at a Rogue Umpire and killed it during Season Eight, the Miami Dale propose the Triple Kill plan. They request other teams&#39; voting assistance to win the three blessings in this season&#39;s election that would incinerate players: Kill Your Darling, Dead Weight, and New Kid. They hope that this plan results in three more Rogue Umpire deaths</li>

               An image of The Monitor appears on the Idol Board, following the most idolized Shelled player. The running theory assumes that The Monitor will eat (or, at least, attempt to eat) this player
               <ul>
                  <li>The Unlimited Tacos, in an effort to protect the Pitching Machine (who occupies the top Shelled Idol slot), propose the Brawl in the Hall plan. This plan proposes the idolization of Tacos lineup player Francisca Sasquatch as an attempt to sacrifice Sasquatch rather than the Pitching Machine</li>
                  <li>
                     The Canada Moist Talkers - a team with an affinity for The Monitor, having proclaimed it their &quot;Moist God&quot; - pitch an alternative plan (with the Tacos&#39; support): The Polka-Munion. This plan pushes the Shelled Moist Talkers pitcher PolkaDot Patterson into the top Shelled slot

                     On Day 1 during a game between the San Francisco Lovers and the Breckenridge Jazz Hands, a new event triggers during Too Many Birds weather. As per the ticker, &quot;A flock of Crows ambush Alexander Horne! They run to safety, resulting in an out.&quot; This occurs during the top of the 12th inning, and is the third out for Horne&#39;s team, the Lovers
                     <ul>
                        <li>This out fails to trigger the end of the inning, granting the Lovers a 16 out inning before the issue is resolved. They score a total of 7 runs, bringing the score to 12-5 for the Lovers, who win the game with a final score of 12-6</li>

                     Due to their permanent Flickering status effects, NaN of the Unlimited Tacos and Jaylen Hotdogfingers of the Seattle Garages are both Feedbacked multiple times over the course of the season. Sixpack Dogwalker of the Hawai'i Fridays also possesses the modifier, but only Feedbacks once on Day 69, swapping to the Dallas Steaks
                     <ul>
                        <li>NaN is the first to Feedback on Day 6, swapping to the Houston Spies. NaN is Feedbacked a total of 3 times over the course of the season, moving from the Spies to the Mexico City Wild Wings, and then finally to the San Francisco Lovers</li>
                        <li>Jaylen Hotdogfingers Feedbacks 4 times starting on Day 7. Hotdogfingers moves from the Garages to the Philly Pies, back to the Garages, on to the Canada Moist Talkers, and finally to the Charleston Shoe Thieves to finish the season</li>

               During Peanut weather, giant peanuts now occasionally crash into the field. The first time this happens, it appears only as text in the game ticker that states &quot;A Big Peanut crashes into the field!&quot;
               <ul>
                  <li>During the Unlimited Tacos vs. Boston Flowers game on Day 96, a second Big Peanut falls, but this time the ticker reads &quot;A Big Peanut has crashed into the field, encasing Wyatt Quitter!&quot; Wyatt Quitter of the Tacos is now Shelled</li>

                  <li>
                     The Fridays enter Party Time on Day 73, becoming the earliest team to do so
                     <ul>
                        <li>While in Party Time, Fridays players partied a total of 16 times</li>
                        <li>On Day 99, Fridays players party 3 times. Players on the opposing team (the Kansas City Breath Mints) party twice, bringing the party total to 5 in one game</li>

               The first Wild Cards series occurs, with the Hawai'i Fridays playing against the Hades Tigers, and the Chicago Firefighters playing against the Hellmouth Sunbeams. The Tigers and Sunbeams emerge victorious in their respective series, leaving the playoffs lineup unaffected
               <ul>
                  <li>The Hawai'i Fridays proceed to break two more league records during the Wild Cards series, being the team with the lowest win-loss record to have participated in the postseason, as well as that win-loss record earning them the dubious honor of being the team with the lowest win-loss record to actually win a postseason game</li>

               The site returns to a game screen, but not in the typical sense: it displays as a video game-style boss battle, The Shelled One displayed at the top of the screen taunting its opposition - the newly crowned season champions, the Charleston Shoe Thieves. Both teams have a &quot;health&quot; bar that displays above the game ticker (clarified in modifier flavour text as being called Team Spirit, see below)

                     The Shelled One now has a team of its own: THE SHELLED ONE&#39;S PODS. This consists of every currently Shelled or Honey Roasted player in the League. Any Shelled player becomes unshelled and gains the Honey Roasted modifier as well. All players are lineup players except for Axel Trololol, the new team's only pitcher. The team&#39;s players are as follows, along with their previous teams:

                     THE SHELLED ONE'S PODS have a total of seven permanent modifiers:

                        <li>
                           <u>Peanut Rain</u>: This team weaponizes Peanut weather against their enemies
                           <ul>
                              <li>Occasionally during this game (or Boss Fight, as becomes the more common terminology) peanuts fall from the sky, damaging the opposing team&#39;s Team Spirit</li>

                        </li>
                        <li><u>Crunchy</u>: The Honey-Roasted players on a Crunchy team will hit 100% better and with +200% Power</li>
                        <li><u>God</u>: This team will start with 1,000x the amount of Team Spirit</li>
                        <li>
                           <u>The Fourth Strike</u>: Those with The Fourth Strike will get an extra strike in each at bat
                           <ul>
                              <li>This modifier functions identically to the one awarded to regular teams, first appearing as a Decree during Season Two</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <u>Curse of Crows</u>: This team or player will be occasionally attacked by birds
                           <ul>
                              <li>This modifier, when triggered, mirrors the event which triggered Crowvertime during the main season (but does not suffer the same game-breaking outs glitch)</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <u>Subjection</u>: Players leaving a team with Subjection will gain the Liberated modification
                           <ul>
                              <li>Theories state that Liberation can be accomplished via idolization and player thefts awarded by certain Blessings that steal players idolized to various extents. The effect of the Liberated modifier is unclear, as it has never appeared before</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>

               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         </li>
         <li>The Shelled One rapidly shifts weather over the course of the game/battle</li>
         <li>Actions such as strikes, outs, and scoring deal damage to the team negatively affected (for example, strikes deal damage to the team incurring them, and runs scored deal damage to the team scored against)</li>
         <li>
            At the midpoint of the game, The Shelled One declares its own benevolence and boosts the Shoe Thieves&#39; Team Spirit from one point to beyond the count which they started with
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Around this time, The Microphone Tweets again to offer encouragement to Hotdogfingers, who is pitching against THE SHELLED ONE&#39;S PODS
                  <ul>

            Ultimately, the Shoe Thieves are defeated, and The Shelled One takes up the entire screen again to make one more statement

               <li>This is later revealed to be a site error (not present for all players), which is resolved fully for Season Ten</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Ten minute&#39;s after The Shelled One departs, The Monitor appears

                  <li><u>Forecast: Birds</u>: EMERGENCY ALERT / SEVERE MURMURATION WARNING IN THIS AREA</li>

                           Three modifiers are randomly distributed to players on each team

                              <li>
                                 <u>Fire Eater</u>: Fire Eaters swallow fire instead of being incinerated
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>Beyond just being immune to incineration, when the Fire Eater modifier triggers, it changes to the Magmatic modifier, granting the player bearing it a guaranteed home run during their next at bat. It then reverts</li>

                                 <u>Siphon</u>: Siphons will steal blood more often in Blooddrain and use it more ways

                                    <li>Siphons now occasionally use the Blooddrain to trigger new effects, such as removing a strike that they have incurred</li>

            <li>The Fifth Base Bubble Blessing goes to the Baltimore Crabs, giving all teams except for those in the Wild High division a fifth base to run before scoring</li>
            <li>
               The Seattle Garages win the Out of Sight Blessing, which sends four of their players to their Shadows. Notably, this returns Mike Townsend to play in exchange for Ortiz Morse (Townsend being the first player ever to &quot;retreat to the Shadows&quot; in exchange for Jaylen Hotdogfingers&#39; resurrection)

            <li>The Miami Dale win only one incineration Blessing, New Kid, but the target of that incineration (Don Elliott) is, indeed, protected by the Iffey Jr.</li>
            <li>The Unlimited Tacos win the Downsizing Blessing, further reducing their team to an eight player roster by sending Wyatt Dovenpart to the Shadows</li>

               Once again, icons are present on the Idolboard, this time corresponding to weather types
               <ul>
                  <li>Birds icons on slots 3 and 12</li>
                  <li>Eclipse icons on slots 6 and 15</li>

                  <li>
                     A Feedback icon on slot 14
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           Various pieces of evidence point to the 14th slot being intended for Jaylen Hotdogfingers to occupy at the conclusion of the main season
                           <ul>
                              <li>The Mic&#39;s Tweets referencing Jaylen</li>
                              <li>The Bulletin section on the main site states that &quot;Wyatt initiated Phase 2 of the Plan, restructuring Jaylen&#39;s Debt and encouraging players around the league to Repeat history, filling out paradoxical scoresheets for the numbers nerds.&quot; Theories state that this means that Jaylen is meant to occupy the 14th slot on the Idolboard, the same slot that they occupied in order to trigger the Necromancy that brought them back. Incidentally, Repeating was the last modifier that Jaylen caused prior to their debt being removed.</li>
                              <li>The Blaseball Beat (a newsletter sent out to email addresses registered to the site) states &quot;Elsewhere, the Microphone appears to have moved into a new phase of its Plan. After putting Jaylen in the right place at the wrong time, the Microphone urged the undead ace to accept the terms of yet another, even more mysterious deal, bringing warnings of a hostile takeover.&quot;</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Later on in the Season, the Baltimore Crabs begin pushing Tillman Henderson (a deceased pitcher) up the Idolboard to occupy an Eclipse slot, citing the humor in seeing him Incinerated twice. However, upon reaching a weather slot, his name and the slot&#39;s number begin to glow blue, and the Microphone begins to Tweet once more
                           <ul>
                              <li><span style="color:#FF00FF";>focus wyatt / help them / Remember / CLEAR / friends / they&#39;re still here / i can see them / give them power / FRIENDS / rise / Remember. / rise / RISE</span></li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           A push begins to get six deceased players into the Birds, Eclipse, and Blooddrain slots (cited with their teams prior to Incineration, and the dates that they played in Season/Day format): <span style="color:f7d1ff";>Caligula Lotus</span> (Boston Flowers, 3/47-6/31) to Slot 3, <span style="color:5c1c1c";>Landry Violence</span> (Hades Tigers, 1/1-3/110) to Slot 6, <span style="color:f5feff";>Workman Gloom</span> (Charleston Shoe Thieves, Canada Moist Talkers, 1/1-7/81) to Slot 9, <span style="color:8c8d8f";>Sebastian Telephone</span> (Dallas Steaks, 1/1-7/67) to Slot 12, <span style="color:593037";>Tillman Henderson</span> (Baltimore Crabs, 1/1-9/64) to Slot 15, and <span style="color:6388ad";>Randall Marijuana</span> (Hellmouth Sunbeams, Breckenridge Jazz Hands, 1/1-6/84) to Slot 18. These players ware chosen due to their popularity in the Hall of Flame, as well as to represent as wide a spread of the League&#39;s teams as possible
                           <ul>
                              <li>The plan is almost a total success, but the New York Millenials&#39; Thomas Dracaena winds up in slot 18 rather than Marijuana, and Hahn Fox of the Sunbeams in slot 12 instead of Telephone, at the end of the main Season. The players occupying those slots - deceased or not - gain the Siphon, Friend of Crows, or Fire Eater modifiers according the the weather type of the slot occupied</li>
                              <li>
                                 The Microphone begins to Tweet as the results are finalized
                                 <ul>
                                    <li><span style="color:#FF00FF";>okay / here goes nothing / Yes! / We did it! / It worked! / Hello? / Friends? / Friends where are you? / It&#39;s Wyatt / We did it / It worked / It was supposed to work </span></li>

                                 Upon the results being made available, it is discovered the Jaylen has been called back to the Void, as per the Returned modifier. In Jaylen&#39;s place, pitching for the Shoe Thieves, is Tillman Henderson, who occupied the 14th slot in the Hall of Flame. This mirrored Jaylen&#39;s position on the Idolboard, presumably the reason that he was the one to take their place. Henderson now has the Returned modifier
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>The Microphone simply Tweets <span style="color:#FF00FF";>oh no</span></li>

            <li>On Season 10, Day 7 Simon Haley of the Charleston Shoe Thieves scores the game's first Pentaslam (made possible by the Fifth Base Bubble Blessing) in a game against the Philly Pies. Haley is awarded the 4-Blood Blagonball</li>
            <li>
               During the third game of the Postseason Finals, the Baltimore Crabs are up 2-0 against the Shoe Thieves. The Crabs score their 10th run of the game, and the following text appears in the game ticker
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     THE CRABS ACCUMULATE 10 / THE SUN COLLAPSES / THE MOON IS SWALLOWED / THE BLACK HOLE FORMS / SUN 2 RISES / The Black Hole swallowed a Win from the Shoe Thieves!
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           The Shoe Thieves now have a win:loss ratio of -1:2, and the score reverts to 0:0
                           <ul>
                              <li>There is some debate as to whether this was intentional or an accidental triggering of the Black Hole decree present as an option in this Season&#39;s election</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The Crabs win nonetheless and claim their third championship title, securing their Ascension (as per a message in the discord from an Umpire, stating &quot;Ascension is imminent&quot;)</li>

                  <li>
                     The Hall Stars, like the PODS, have many team modifiers
                     <ul>
                        <li><u>Squiddest</u>: This Team is the Squiddest. When a player joins the Team, they&#39;ll become Squiddish</li>
                        <li><u>Chaotic</u>: The Unstable players on a Chaotic team will be 100% better</li>
                        <li>
                           <u>Tribute</u>: When Hall of Flame players join this team, they&#39;ll add their Tribute as Team Spirit
                           <ul>
                              <li>The only time that this modifier triggers during the game is when Sebastian Telephone is Incinerated (for a second time), and is replaced by Scrap Murphy, formerly of the New York Millenials</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <u>Loyalty</u>: Players leaving a team with Loyalty will gain the Saboteur modification
                           <ul>
                              <li><u>Saboteur</u>: A Saboteur has a chance of intentionally failing</li>
                              <li>This triggers several times as Jaylen&#39;s Flickering causes Feedback weather, Hotdogfingers and Axel Trololol switching teams several times over the course of the game</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><u>Pending</u>: The players on this Team are Pending...</li>
                        <li><u>Containment</u>: When an Unstable player on this team is incinerated, the Instability cannot chain to their opponent</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The teams vie for superiority, with The Hall Monitor appearing in the background behind The Shelled One with increasing prominence as THE SHELLED ONE&#39;S PODS&#39; Team Spirit is chipped away</li>
            <li>The Shelled One makes jabs as before, such as referencing York Silk as <span style="color:red";>MY DORK</span> and chanting <span style="color:red";>RING RING</span> when Jessica Telephone comes up to bat, but gets increasingly panicked as it starts to lose Team Spirit, declaring things like <span style="color:red";>THAT HURT?!</span> and <span style="color:red";>YOU&#39;RE CHEATING</span>, and begging its team to crush the opposition</li>
            <li>The Hall Stars emerge victorious, with Landry Violence becoming Magmatic (due to Violence&#39;s Idolboard-granted Fire Eater modifier) and scoring a home run, closely followed by Dominic Marijuana scoring the final run to secure victory</li>
         </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            The site returns, but The Hall Monitor quickly appears
            <ul>
               <li><span style="color:#5988ff";>cronch / hmm / kinda bland / you all eat these? / what&#39;s the point / oh well / deal&#39;s a deal / almost forgot / Boss is on her way / you might want to clean up a bit</span></li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            The site finally returns for good (for now). Notably, the players on The Hall Stars are absent from the Hall of Flame
            <ul>
               <li>
                  The Microphone sends out another series of Tweets
                  <ul>
                     <li><span style="color:#FF00FF";>Friends / Jaylen / I can&#39;t see you anymore / If you can hear me / Thank you / Wherever you are / I hope you get to rest</span></li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
