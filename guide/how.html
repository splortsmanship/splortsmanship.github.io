                 Now, the fun part.

                 <br>
                 If you're here, I'm going to assume that you've made an account on the site and picked a team! If not, go do that now. I'll wait. (The teams and some notable events for each can be found <a href="teams.html">here</a>)
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Once you're situated on a team (situated being relative, if you find it's not for you, you can switch with a Flute during the first part of the season), you're going to want to purchase shop access and start growing your economy. The best way to do so varies from season to season!

                 So - what does that all mean?
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Your <b>Idol</b> is a player that will pay out coins if they meet certain criteria. For example, Pickles pay out whenever your idol steals a base. An idol can be selected by navigating to their player page, either from their team page or via the search bar, and clicking the idol icon (it's worth noting here that you do need 200 coins to do this, so don't go too ham on snacks right off the bat):
              </p>

             <figcaption>That one! The bright green one! Right there!</figcaption>
             <p>
               Also: Currently, a rule called "All You Can Eat" is in play. This means that, theoretically, you could buy an absolute ton of slots and have every snack (people have tried), but it's ill-advixed, since having FEWER snacks increases the % bonus to what that snack would normally pay out. If you have <i>too many</i> slots, your snacks will pay out less than their base coin amount or, worse, nothing at all. Your current snack payout is always visible in the Shop.
             </p>

             <p>
               Once you've got your idol, you'll likely end up building your economy for a couple of seasons. Thankfully, this doesn't take too terribly long to do! Once you've maxed out your snack of choice (they generally cap at 99), you can start thinking about things like <b>renovations</b>, the <b>gift shop</b>, and...
               <br>
               <br>
               <b>ELECTIONS.</b>
               <br>
               <br>
               Also, while we're talking economy, a note on Eat the Rich: Eat the Rich is a League rule wherein, on Sunday each week, the richest 1% of fans get "eaten". This takes all of their money, and doles it out evenly to the rest of the league. The 1% mark currently sits somewhere over 200k coins, so you're probably safe for now! However, if Sunday rolls around and your pockets are feeling a bit heavy, it's best to spend down. Unless you're feeling generous. Then that's just awful nice of you.

             <h2>Earlsiesta, Renovations, and the Gift Shop</h2>
             <p>
               Earlsiesta is a (roughly) one hour break that falls between games 27 and 28 every season. During this break, fans gain access to both Renovations and Gift Shops.
               <br>
               <br>
               <b>Renovations</b> allow fans to donate coins to their own team in order to add modifications to their Ballpark. The most popular renovations pass, with each successive renovation becoming more expensive based on A) how many Renovations the team has already funded this season and B) how many Renovations the team funded the season prior. These renovations can do anything from making home runs harder/easier to hit in the Ballpark to installing Hoops, which allow players to attempt an alley oop for an extra run after one of their teammates hits a homer.
               <br>
               <br>
               The <b>Gift Shop</b> allows fans to both donate coins to other teams, or to donate coins once again to their own team to build a Wishlist. Much like Renovations, more gifts = exponentially more coins. A team's Wishlist may consist of items to buff/debuff their players, team mods to protect from Incineration, or even Replicas of Vaulted players.
               <br>
               <br>
               In order to access both Renovations and your team's Wishlist, you'll have to snag a Pizza from the shop!
