                 Now, the fun part.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 If you're here, I'm going to assume that you've made an account on the site and picked a team! If not, go do that now. I'll wait. (The teams and some notable events for each can be found <a href="teams.html">here</a>)
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Once you're situated on a team (situated being relative, if you find it's not for you, you can switch with a Flute during the first part of the season), you're going to want to purchase shop access and start growing your economy. The best way to do so varies from season to season! 
              </p>

                 <h3>Current Snack Meta</h3>
                 <p class="meta">
                    Solo PICKLES on DON MITCHELL (Hawaii Fridays)
                    <br>
                    OR
                    <br>
                    Solo COLD FRIES on Adalberto Tosser (Baltimore Crabs)

              </div>
              <p>
                 So - what does that all mean?
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Your <b>Idol</b> is a player that will pay out coins if they meet certain criteria. For example, Pickles pay out whenever your idol steals a base. An idol can be selected by navigating to their player page, either from their team page or via the search bar, and clicking the idol icon (it's worth noting here that you do need 200 coins to do this, so don't go too ham on snacks right off the bat):
              </p>
             <img alt="idol button" src="https://github.com/splortsmanship/splortsmanship.github.io/blob/main/images/idol.png?raw=true" width="477" height="103" class="center">
             <figcaption>That one! The bright green one! Right there!</figcaption>
             <p>
               Once you've got your idol, you'll likely end up building your economy for a couple of seasons. Thankfully, this doesn't take too terribly long to do! Once you've maxed out your snack of choice (they generally cap at 99), you can start thinking about things like <b>renovations</b>, the <b>gift shop</b>, and...
               <br>
               <br>
               <b>ELECTIONS.</b>
               <br>
               <br>
               Also, while we're talking economy, a note on Eat the Rich: Eat the Rich is a League rule wherein, on Sunday each week, the richest 1% of fans get "eaten". This takes all of their money, and doles it out evenly to the rest of the league. The 1% mark currently sits somewhere over 200k coins, so you're probably safe for now! However, if Sunday rolls around and your pockets are feeling a bit heavy, it's best to spend down. Unless you're feeling generous. Then that's just awful nice of you.
