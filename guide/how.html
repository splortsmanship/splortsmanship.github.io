                 Now, the fun part.

                 <br>
                 If you're here, I'm going to assume that you've made an account on the site and picked a team! If not, go do that now. I'll wait. (The teams and some notable events for each can be found <a href="teams.html">here</a>)
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Once you're situated on a team (situated being relative, if you find it's not for you, you can switch with a Flute during the first part of the season), you're going to want to purchase shop access and start growing your economy. The best way to do so varies from season to season!

                    Solo PICKLES on DON MITCHELL (Hawaii Fridays)
                    <br>

                 <br>
                 Your <b>Idol</b> is a player that will pay out coins if they meet certain criteria. For example, Pickles pay out whenever your idol steals a base. An idol can be selected by navigating to their player page, either from their team page or via the search bar, and clicking the idol icon (it's worth noting here that you do need 200 coins to do this, so don't go too ham on snacks right off the bat):
