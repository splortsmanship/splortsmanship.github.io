            You may be feeling a few things right now: Confused, excited, overwhelmed, etc. Which makes sense! Blaseball can be <i>a lot</i>. The goal of this guide is to make your introduction to the splort a little bit less overwhelming.
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>(If you'd like to skip the game's narrative history and jump right to the mechanics/how to play, click <a href="#how.html">HERE</a>)</i>
            <br>
            <br>  
            The first thing I'm going to do is explain <i>what</i> exactly Blaseball is. We'll touch on how it <i>works</i> later, but with the sheer degree of narrative progression it has undergone, trying to do both at once is nearly impossible. Blaseball started as, essentially, a baseball simulator with funny names. That was, essentially, all it was until the opening of the Forbidden Book at the end of Season 1. This started its climb toward becoming more narrative horror than sport, and now it is in its third Era. To start, let's cover <b>Discipline</b>.
            <br>
            <br>

          <h2>The Discipline Era</h2>

          <p>
            The Discipline Era technically started during Season 2, but for the sake of simplicity I'll be including Season 1 as well since, until its Election - an event every season during which user votes are tallied to enact new game rules or make changes to teams - nothing really <i>happened</i>. The opening of the Book, however, caused Jaylen Hotdogfingers, a pitcher for the Seattle Garages, to be Incinerated. When a player is Incinerated, they are removed from their team's roster and sent to the Hall of Flame, a list of Deceased Players. That player is then replaced with a new, randomly rolled player, often referred to as a New Egg. The Incinerations continued, putting players at risk during Solar Eclipses, the first of many weather types that can occur during games (more on those later).
            <br>
            <br>
            During Season 3, we met the first of Blaseball's many gods: The Shelled One. A giant peanut, it would take over the site to deliver ominous messages. Its threats continued over the rest of the Era, particularly after fans resurrected Jaylen Hotdogfingers in the League's first act of necromancy. Which is, in and of itself, a hell of a phrase.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's break that down a little bit:
            <br>
            <br>
            At the beginning of Season 6, the Idol Board was added to the site. Players could choose an idol, and profit off of their successes on the field. Alongside it, a Blessing appeared allowing a team to recruit the player in its 14th slot. Fans quickly realized that deceased players could be idolized, and summarily worked to move Hotdogfingers into that 14th slot. The Election saw their efforts realized, with Jaylen returning to pitch for the Seattle Garages. Of course, defying a god did not come without a price.

            <br>
            Jaylen returned with Debt: a mechanic causing them to hit batters with pitchers, making them Unstable. This instability caused them to be much more likely to be Incinerated during Solar Eclipses, and when they <i>were</i> could spread to their fellow players. However, when Jaylen returned to play, she did not return alone. A second god - The Monitor - followed Jaylen back from the hall.
