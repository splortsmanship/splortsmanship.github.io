               The site enters a siesta on the evening of February 28th, 2021
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     The monitor appears

                     The site reappears with new features:

                           <u>Schedule Change</u>: The site now displays a schedule, breaking the season down into segments:

      <h3>Earlseason</h3>
      <ul>
         <li id="coffee">
            All prior weather types return, including weather from the Coffee Cup:
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <u>Coffee 1</u>: Players can become "Tired" or "Wired" by being Beaned by different kinds of coffee beans 
                  <ul>
                     <li>Tired: <i>When a Run scores, each Tired player involved in the play (the Scoring Baserunner, Current Batter, or Current Pitcher) will make the Run worth 0.5 less.</i></li>
                     <li>Wired: <i>When a Run scores, each Wired player involved in the play (the Scoring Baserunner, Current Batter, or Current Pitcher) will make the Run worth 0.5 more.</i></li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <u>Coffee 2</u>: Players can be Poured Over, granting them the Free Refill modification
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        Free Refill: <i>Good for one Free Refill</i>

                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <u>Coffee 3</u>: Pitchers who are active during this weather gain Triple Threat
                  <ul>
                     <li>Triple Threat: <i>This pitcher's strikeouts score Unruns when there are 3 runners on base, a runner on 3rd, or 3 Balls in the count. Each condition met is worth .3 Unruns. At the end of the 3rd Inning, there's a 33.33% chance that this mod will disappear.</i></li>

               </li>
               <li>
                  Fans who click on the Black Hole weather tooltip quickly discover that it brings up the Team page of the Baltimore Crabs. This has all the same information as the other teams, but displayed an additional tab, the full title of which is obscured by a "KEEP OUT" graphic, save for the letters "RK". Clicking this tab reveals the following:
                  <ul>
                     <li><span style="color: white";>Chesapeake Racetrack and Ballpark / <i>"The Crabitat"</i></span></li>

               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            On Day 1, in a game between the Canada Moist Talkers and the Yellowstone Magic, Chorby Short bats 111 consecutive fouls in a single at-bat due to the O No Blessing, which the Magic received during the Season 10 Election. The Blessing causes their batters to be incapable of striking out until a Ball is thrown
            <ul>
               <li>The Moist Talkers' pitcher for the game is PolkaDot Patterson, who Walked a total of 3 batters the Season prior</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li id="overperform">
            Also on Day 1, Sandoval Crossing of the Hellmouth Sunbeams, a player with the Superyummy modification, gains the Underperforming modification. The game ticker states "Sandoval Crossing misses Peanuts"
            <ul>
               <li>Underperforming: <i>This Player will play 20% worse than usual</i></li>
               <li>On Day 26, during a game in Peanuts weather, the ticker states "Sandoval Crossing loves Peanuts", and they gain the Overperforming modification
                  <ul>
                     <li>Overperforming: <i>This Player will play 20% better than usual</i></li>
                  </ul>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            The Microphone begins to Tweet after Day 1's games conclude

         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Earlsiesta</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            The first Seasonal Reading occurs. The cards, in order from left to right are I The Magician (Yellowstone Magic), XII The Hanged Man (Hellmouth Sunbeams), and XIIII Temperance (Chicago Firefighters)
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Players on the Magic and the Firefighters both receive permanent modifications:
                  <ul>
                     <li>Curry Aliciakeyes on the Magic receives <u>Over Under</u>: Whenever this pitcher's team has Over 5 Runs, they'll Underperform</li>
                     <li>Kennedy Rogers on the Firefighters receives <u>Under Over</u>: Whenever this pitcher's team has Under 5 Runs, they'll Overperform</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Fans that remain on the Baltimore Crabs despite Ascension and purchase the Pizza raise one million coins to construct their Ballpark, all the while receiving warnings on the site such as "DO NOT FUND", "CEASE AND DESIST", and lastly, "BREACH IMMINENT"
            <ul>
               <li>Crabs fans are able to select various stadium styles - presumably giving them some kind of gameplay advantage - while contributing</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Midseason</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            On Day 37 in a Peanuts game between the Houston Spies and the Tokyo Lift, Wyatt Quitter of the Lift "tastes the infite" and Shells Spies player Denzel Scott
            <ul>
               <li>Fans link this back to Quitter's possession of the Honey Roasted modification, which was given to all members of THE SHELLED ONE'S PODS. This is confirmed on Day 56, when Peanut Bong of the LA Unlimited Tacos SHells Nerd Pacheco of the Hellmouth Sunbeams under the same weather conditions</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Latesiesta</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>

                        The Baltimore Crabs Descend, accompanied by three entirely new teams: The Core Mechanics, the Atlantis Georgias, and the Ohio Worms. Each team has its own modification, each player on the team has Base 2 Evolution, and the teams do not play during Season 12
                        <ul>
                           <li>The Atlantis Georgias receive <u>Undersea</u>: If this team ever has negative Runs, they'll Overperform for the rest of the game</li>
