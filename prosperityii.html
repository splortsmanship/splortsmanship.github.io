               The site enters a siesta on the evening of February 28th, 2021
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     The monitor appears

                  <u>Coffee 1</u>: Players can become "Tired" or "Wired" by being Beaned by different kinds of coffee beans

                     <li>Wired: <i>When a Run scores, each Wired player involved in the play (the Scoring Baserunner, Current Batter, or Current Pitcher) will make the Run worth 0.5 more.</i></li>
                  </ul>

                  <u>Coffee 2</u>: Players can be Poured Over, granting them the Free Refill modification

                     </li>

                     </ul>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <u>Coffee 3</u>: Pitchers who are active during this weather gain Triple Threat
                  <ul>
                     <li>Triple Threat: <i>This pitcher's strikeouts score Unruns when there are 3 runners on base, a runner on 3rd, or 3 Balls in the count. Each condition met is worth .3 Unruns. At the end of the 3rd Inning, there's a 33.33% chance that this mod will disappear.</i></li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  Fans who click on the Black Hole weather tooltip quickly discover that it brings up the Team page of the Baltimore Crabs. This has all the same information as the other teams, but displayed an additional tab, the full title of which is obscured by a "KEEP OUT" graphic, save for the letters "RK". Clicking this tab reveals the following:
                  <ul>
                     <li><span style="color: white";>Chesapeake Racetrack and Ballpark / <i>"The Crabitat"</i></span></li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            On Day 1, in a game between the Canada Moist Talkers and the Yellowstone Magic, Chorby Short bats 111 consecutive fouls in a single at-bat due to the O No Blessing, which the Magic received during the Season 10 Election. The Blessing causes their batters to be incapable of striking out until a Ball is thrown
            <ul>
               <li>The Moist Talkers' pitcher for the game is PolkaDot Patterson, who Walked a total of 3 batters the Season prior</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Also on Day 1, Sandoval Crossing of the Hellmouth Sunbeams, a player with the Superyummy modification, gains the Underperforming modification. The game ticker states "Sandoval Crossing misses Peanuts"
            <ul>
               <li>Underperforming: <i>This Player will play 20% worse than usual</i></li>
               <li>On Day 26, during a game in Peanuts weather, the ticker states "Sandoval Crossing loves Peanuts", and they gain the Overperforming modification
                  <ul>
                     <li>Overperforming: <i>This Player will play 20% better than usual</i></li>
                  </ul>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            The Microphone begins to Tweet after Day 1's games conclude
            <ul>
               <li><span style="color: #FF00FF";>friends / you've been asleep for a while / been searching / trying to see what's coming / i found something / i can feel it / here / all around us / closing doors / base dealing / i don't like our chances / it's a coin flip</span></li>
