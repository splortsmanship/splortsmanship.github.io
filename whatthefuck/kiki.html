    <p>
      The Moist Talkers were, to put it lightly, pissed.
      <br>
      It was Season 6, and everyone's best friend, Richmond Harrisson, had been Feedbacked to the Hades Tigers. It was the Talkers' first loss in almost two full seasons, and the fact that Richmond wasn't <i>dead</i> seemed to matter very little. He was an icon, the face of the time. Thus, they were angry.
