            So, you’ve picked a starter class, hit things and watched cutscenes until you reached level 15, and are now presented with your first dungeon. You can be like me when I first played WoW (I’m sorry) and run through your first dungeon tanking without knowing that you are supposed to be the one getting hit, and have several people get very politely angry with you in chat, or you can go through some very basic steps to make sure that you have a rough idea of what you’re doing first.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">IMPORTANT NOTE #1:</span> You don’t have to be perfect on your first run! You don’t have to be perfect, like, ever! We have several jobs (classes become jobs at level 30, it’s a whole thing that we still fuck up constantly) at level 90 and still aren’t perfect at any of them! That’s not what this guide is about!
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">IMPORTANT NOTE #2:</span> Before the game even lets you go into the dungeon, it will point a big foam index finger at the Hall of the Novice. The Hall provides several very helpful tutorials for every role. Please, please do all of the available lessons for your role! Not only will this help you, you know, not stand in AOEs, it will also get you a really nice starter gearset so that you don’t lose half of your health the moment an enemy sneezes at you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">IMPORTANT NOTE #3:</span> Last one, promise. While you <em>could</em> just hop over to the article that explains the role that you, specifically, are playing, I really strongly recommend at least skimming the other two. One of the best ways to improve your performance as any given role is to know how the other two roles play! If you're a tank who understands why your healer hasn't healed you yet after you've taken two whole hits from the boss, or a healer who can keep their cool after your party's Gunbreaker suddenly has a whopping 1 HP, your runs will go a whole lot more smoothly.
            <br>
            <br>
            With those out of the way, lets break down some of the the first of the three roles:

          <h3 class="section">TANKING: HOW TO TAKE A HIT</h3>
          <h6 class="tag">Paladin (Gladiator), Warrior (Marauder), Dark Knight, Gunbreaker</h6>
          <p>
            As a tank, you’re absolutely beefed. Just a walking meat shield. Your job is to get enemies to hit you instead of your extremely squishy friends. Your other job is to make sure that those hits are deflected off of your <em>mitigation abilities</em> so that your healer doesn’t run out of <em>MP</em> after two <em>pulls</em>. Some of those words are in italics because I’m going to explain them later, and that feels like a nice way to denote that.

            At level 10, every tank gets an ability that causes them to generate more Enmity (AKA aggro/hate, the stuff that makes enemies want to beat the ever-loving shit out of you) than everyone else, assuming that they do their rotation correctly. When you are running content where you are the only tank, this should always be on. Never turn this off, even if Johnny Leveleightybard keeps sniping enemies across the room because he thinks you’re pulling too slow, and you think that maybe he would like to be the tank instead. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This stance also only really works if, again, you’re doing your rotation correctly. At this level, it’s likely just two buttons that you’re hitting in sequence: usually the first attack you got, and then the one that lights up after you press it. If you’re fighting three or more enemies, replace that with your AOE, which might just be a single attack right now, in which case: just mash that fucker. Easiest job in the game. Early game Paladins are just beyblades, and that’s something that they deal with/enjoy as long as it lasts.
