            So, you’ve picked a starter class, hit things and watched cutscenes until you reached level 15, and are now presented with your first dungeon. You can be like me when I first played WoW (I’m sorry) and run through your first dungeon tanking without knowing that you are supposed to be the one getting hit, and have several people get very politely angry with you in chat, or you can go through some very basic steps to make sure that you have a rough idea of what you’re doing first.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">IMPORTANT NOTE #1:</span> You don’t have to be perfect on your first run! You don’t have to be perfect, like, ever! We have several jobs (classes become jobs at level 30, it’s a whole thing that we still fuck up constantly) at level 90 and still aren’t perfect at any of them! That’s not what this guide is about!
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">IMPORTANT NOTE #2:</span> Before the game even lets you go into the dungeon, it will point a big foam index finger at the Hall of the Novice. The Hall provides several very helpful tutorials for every role. Please, please do all of the available lessons for your role! Not only will this help you, you know, not stand in AOEs, it will also get you a really nice starter gearset so that you don’t lose half of your health the moment an enemy sneezes at you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">IMPORTANT NOTE #3:</span> Last one, promise. While you <em>could</em> just hop over to the article that explains the role that you, specifically, are playing, I really strongly recommend at least skimming the other two. One of the best ways to improve your performance as any given role is to know how the other two roles play! If you're a tank who understands why your healer hasn't healed you yet after you've taken two whole hits from the boss, or a healer who can keep their cool after your party's Gunbreaker suddenly has a whopping 1 HP, your runs will go a whole lot more smoothly.
            <br>
            <br>
            With those out of the way, lets break down our first role:

            As a tank, you’re absolutely beefed. Just a walking meat shield. Your job is to get enemies to hit you instead of your extremely squishy friends. Your other job is to make sure that those hits are deflected off of your <em>mitigation abilities</em> so that your healer doesn’t run out of MP after two <em>pulls</em>. Some of those words are in italics because I’m going to explain them later, and that feels like a nice way to denote that.

            At level 10, every tank gets an ability that causes them to generate more Enmity (AKA aggro/hate, the stuff that makes enemies want to beat the ever-loving shit out of you) than everyone else, assuming that they do their rotation correctly. When you are running content where you are the only tank, this should always be on. Never turn this off, even if Johnny Leveleightybard keeps sniping enemies across the room because he thinks you’re pulling too slowly, and you think that maybe he would like to be the tank instead. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This stance also only really works if, again, you’re doing your rotation correctly. At this level, it’s likely just two buttons that you’re hitting in sequence: usually the first attack you got, and then the one that lights up after you press it. These are combo actions, and hitting them in order gives them a hefty damage boost. If you’re fighting three or more enemies, replace that with your AOE, which might just be a single attack right now, in which case: just mash that fucker. Easiest job in the game. Early game Paladins are just beyblades, and that’s something that they deal with/enjoy as long as it lasts.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">Trash Pulls 101</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            The first enemies that you are going to see when you load into a dungeon are the little guys. Don’t be fooled - these can hit hard in big groups! Generally they’ll be bunched together in packs of 3-5 mobs. These are your trash packs, which can be trash pulled. Easy! But how many do you pull, and how do you do it?
            <br>
            <br>
            The best way to pull a pack is just to run through your AOE rotation. Be sure to complete the full rotation <em>at least once</em> before running to the next pack. Otherwise you may not retain enmity between pulls, meaning that your squishy little party members will start taking a lot of damage. Also, importantly: it is almost never a good idea to start your pulls with your ranged attack, as this means that you’ll make one enemy very angry at you, but won’t be able to pick up the rest until your GCD refreshes.
          </p>
          <div class="infobox">
            <p>
              <span class="infotitle">What the hell is a GCD?</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              Your GCD, or <strong>global cooldown</strong>, refers to the time that it takes for your main abilities to be usable again. You’ll notice that, upon using an ability in your core rotation, most of your other abilities will go on cooldown as well. The abilities that don’t are referred to as oGCD, or <strong>off global cooldown</strong>, abilities. Generally speaking, you can fit two oGCD’s inside of your GCD cooldown. If you have oGCD attacks, be sure to use them! It’s free damage! The cooldowns for these abilities are also generally so short that you don’t have to worry about “wasting” them, so use them, and use them often!

          <p>
            Starting out, you may be tempted to just pull one group. I’m here to tell you that that is absolutely fine. When you’re just starting out, and just freshly learning to tank, operate within your comfort level. My personal recommendation is to try to pull two packs together once you’re comfortable enough to do so, as this ensures that your party can use their AOE abilities as much as possible. However, there are two things to remember when you’re deciding how much to pull:
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>“Healers adjust” is a meme for a reason.</strong> Your ability as a tank is a factor in how many packs you pull, absolutely, but at the end of the day, if your healer can’t keep up with your pulls, it’s on you to scale back. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Mitigate, mitigate, mitigate.</strong> Your healer does not want to be healing you constantly! The run will go much more quickly if they can help DPS mobs down, so the less damage you take, the more they can deal.
            <br>
            <br>
            And speaking of mitigation…
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">Mitigation</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            The most important parts of your kit outside of your tank stance are your mitigation abilities. Three of these are universal - all tanks have them - and the rest will depend on your specific job. Let’s take a quick look at the universal ones:
            <br>

            <strong>Rampart</strong> is a tank's bread and butter. It reduces incoming damage by 20% for 20 seconds. If you're about to take a big hit, like a tankbuster (more on that shortly), it's a great thing to pop.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Reprisal</strong> reduces the damage dealt by enemies around you by 10% for 10 seconds. This is great for trash pulls for obvious reasons, but another great application of Reprisal is to reduce the damage dealt by the party-wide attacks that many bosses use. Reprisal isn’t just about you - it helps anybody who might be taking damage from the enemy or enemies it affects.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Arm’s Length</strong> isn’t a mitigation ability in the technical sense - in fact, it’s not even tank-specific! Melee and ranged DPS get the ability as well, and you may notice that it doesn’t even say it reduces damage. So why is it a mitigation effect? Besides giving you knockback immunity, which can be helpful in and of itself, it also applies a Slow effect to most enemies that hit you. If an enemy can’t hit you as often, it’s dealing less damage. Notably this does not work on bosses, but is incredibly helpful during trash pulls.
            <br>
            <br>
            Below are some examples of some basic job-specific mitigation abilities, to help you get a sense for the slight differences between different mitigations. I won't be going too far into specifics, since they'll be explained in better detail in dedicated job guides, but in short:

          </div>
          <p>
            <strong>Sheltron</strong> increases your block chance to 100% for 4 seconds. Pretty simple, but different from a lot of mitigation in that it’s not really a damage reduction - it changes your block chance, which is a stat granted by a Paladin’s shield.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Raw Intuition</strong> reduces incoming damage by 10% for 6 seconds while also restoring HP every time you use a Weaponskill.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>The Blackest Night</strong> creates a barrier that absorbs damage totalling up to 25% of your maximum HP, and lasting for 7 seconds.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Heart of Stone</strong> can be cast on yourself or on a party member, reducing the damage that the target takes by 15%. Additionally, if it’s cast on someone else, that party member gains the benefit of your Brutal Shell ability, which both heals and creates a barrier when it lands.
            <br>
            <br>
            While these abilities all have roughly the same effect - making hits hurt less - the ways in which they do so can affect when you use them! While it’s not worth worrying too much about optimization when you’re first starting out, it can be helpful to keep an eye out for opportunities to use them to their fullest: a Warrior may use Raw Intuition rather than Rampart if their health is getting worryingly low, for example, or a Gunbreaker may opt to use Heart of Stone on a party member if an upcoming party-wide hit looks poised to knock out their last bit of HP and they’re sitting pretty at nearly full health.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">IMPORTANT NOTE #4:</span> I wasn’t done. I lied. When discussing mitigation, it’s important to mention not to blow every mitigation ability at once! You’ll be the toughest motherfucker on the block for all of about 10 seconds, and then the effects will wear off, and you’ll be about as effective at tanking hits as the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man for the almost minute and a half it takes for Rampart to refresh. Spread them out as much as possible!
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">How to Fight a Boss</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            So, you’ve pulled your trash packs and popped your Reprisals and just generally skipped merrily throughout the dungeon. Now suddenly you’re face to face with a big boss and an even bigger health bar. What now? There are three big rules I encourage tanks to follow during boss fights:
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rule 1: Be ready to take some damage.</strong> By be ready, I don’t just mean accepting the damage as a fact of life. Work to learn what a boss’s attacks do and how to respond! Not standing in AOEs is a big one, but knowing which attacks are tankbusters, or which ones will hit the whole party, is an important part of your job. Almost every boss will have a tankbuster, which is a high damage attack that targets the player with the most enmity. At this point, that really should be you. When you see the boss start to cast one of these, it’s the ideal time to use some mitigation. Bosses will also usually have at least one ability that will deal damage to everyone in your party, and knowing to pop a Reprisal or other party-wide damage reduction ability will make your healer love you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rule 2: Don’t cleave the party.</strong> Speaking of boss attacks, some have abilities known as cleaves. These usually take the form of a cone in front of the boss, and won’t be telegraphed, meaning that there won’t be an AOE zone on the floor. If you know that the boss has a cleave, or don’t know for sure that it doesn’t, best practice is to make sure that it’s turned so that it’s facing away from the party. Most bosses can be pulled straight to the far end of the arena, which means that the only person being hit by the cleave is you, because you can take it. You’re tough.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rule 3: The boss is not a Beyblade.</strong> Try to keep the boss as still as possible. This means trying not to lead it in a wild chase around the arena, and not spinning it around a whole ton. This is partially because of Rule 2, but will also allow your melee DPS to deal more damage - many of them have positionals, meaning that certain abilities deal more damage when executed from either the back or flank of the boss, depending on the ability. If the boss is spinning, they are going to have a very hard time getting into position for them.
