            So, you’ve picked a starter class, hit things and watched cutscenes until you reached level 15, and are now presented with your first dungeon. You can be like me when I first played WoW (I’m sorry) and run through your first dungeon tanking without knowing that you are supposed to be the one getting hit, and have several people get very politely angry with you in chat, or you can go through some very basic steps to make sure that you have a rough idea of what you’re doing first.
