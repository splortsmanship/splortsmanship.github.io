          A new weather type appears: Flooding. This occasionally causes a "surge of Immateria" to wash all current baserunners off of the bases. When this happens, it also occasionally sends a player Elsewhere, giving them the Elsewhere modification. A player who is Elsewhere is removed from play for an indefinite amount of time, having a chance to return to play during another game
          <ul>
            <li>
              <u>Elsewhere</u>: This player is Elsewhere. They'll find their own way back.

              The <u>Based Evolution</u> decree passes
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li>

                      Rather than Ascending (cancelled after the Shelled One's defeat), teams that win three Championships will now Evolve. A team that "rounds the evolutionary bases" will go "Home"
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          The Hades Tigers gain the <u>Ambush</u> modification, and all of their Players gain Base 1 Evolution
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              <u>Ambush</u>: When a player is incinerated in a game this team is playing, a Hall of Flame player will join their Shadows.
                            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              The first round of Wills passes, causing many Player swaps between teams. Two new Modifications come into play as well:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Players who benefit from the Trust Will receive the <u>Flippers</u> Modification
                  <ul>
                    <li><u>Flippers</u>: When immateria floods, this Runner will score instead of being cleared from the Bases.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pudge Nakamoto, who is targeted by the Revoke Will, receives the <u>Roamin'</u> Modification and moves to the Charleston Shoe Thieves
                  <ul>
                    <li><u>Roamin'</u>: This player has a chance of Roamin' to a new team at the end of each season.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The "The Big Sip" and "Uncle Indemnity" Blessings recruit two Coffee Cup-exclusive players from the BC Noir team to the San Francisco Lovers and New York Millennials respectively: Liquid Friend and Uncle Plasma. Both players have the <u>Hard Boiled</u> Modification
              <ul>
                <li><u>Hard Boiled</u>: This player was boiled a little bit before hatching</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        </li>
      </ul>
  <h3>Gods' Day</h3>

    <li>
      New items are added to the concession
      <ul>
        <li>Pickles: <i>Earn X coins every time your Idol steals a base.</i></li>
        <li>Slushie: <i>Earn X coins for every baserunner swept away by Flooding weather across the league.</i></li>
        <li>Wet Pretzel: <i>Earn 100 coins for every time the Black Hole swallows a Win from any Team.</i></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Idols page receives an update, declaring MVP voting to be in effect. The Top 9 idols each season will be named the season's MVPs and receive an "Ego Boost"</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="season-thirteen">Season Thirteen</h2>
  <h3>Preseason</h3>

          <span style="color: #FF00FF";>spla--ed / fo--s --att / g--tin- ---tter-d</span>

        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      On Day 13, Sutton Picklestein of the Yellowstone Magic is incinerated
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fans, being unsure of whether the Ego Boost referenced on the Idols page would be beneficial or detrimental, begin organizing on the Discord to move Shadowed and Hard Boiled players into the top slots. Post-incineration, Picklestein is added to this initiative, titled the "Dom Wom Joe Bong Yams Con MVP Plan Extravaganza with Pickles"
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Flooding continues to occur and sweep batters Elsewhere, and those who spend a long time Elsewhere begin to return with letters missing from their names, and have the modification <u>Scattered</u>:This Player returned from Elsewhere a bit Scattered
      <ul>
        <li>
          Scattered players have no Vibes
        </li>
        <li>
          Missing letters gradually return, and the Scattered modification is removed once player names are restored 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Earlsiesta</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The seasonal reading occurs. From left to right, the drawn cards are II The High Priestess (Hawai'i Fridays), XV The Devil (Hades Tigers), and XX Judgement (San Francisco Lovers)
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Hawai'i Fridays receive the permanent team modification <u>Sinking Ship</u>: This team plays 1% worse for every player above 14 players on their roster, and 1% better for every player below 14 on their roster
        </li>
        <li>
          The San Francisco Lovers receive the seasonal team modification <u>Base Dealing</u>: This Team's lineup will advance in reverse order
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Lovers' lineup is also "optimized", sorting their batters from lowest combined stars to highest
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The rest of the League begins Ballpark construction, while the Baltimore Crabs begin to fund their first set of Renovations
      <ul>
        <li>
          A team making Renovations to their Stadium can fund choices from a list of options, with multiple Renovations being possible but progressively more expensive. The most popular Renovations are added to the Ballpark
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Latesiesta</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ballpark construction is completed. Notably, the League constructs many Ballparks with the Boreal and Loge prefabs, which have very low Fortification stats, making Weather events such as Incinerations much more common
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Lateseason</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      After games conclude on Day 99, The Boss appears
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span style="colour: #ede06d";>What an Incredible Season! / Congratulations to Our MVPs. / Under enormous pressure, / These Players have risen to the top! / York Silk / Nagomi McDaniel / Aldon Cashmoney / Sexton Wheerer / Wyatt Glover / Goodwin Morin / Peanut Bong / Sutton Picklestein / Jessica Telephone / Pitching Machine / Trust Us / When We say / The weight of this accomplishment cannot be overstated. / You're all winners!</span>

            <li>
              MVPs receive the modification <u>Ego+</u>: This player has a boosted Ego
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Players with Ego+ are not swept off of bases during Flooding weather

  <ul>
    <li>
      The Free Wills Decree passes, granting the bottom four teams in the League each Season a third Will
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span style="color: white";>WILLS EXPAND / SEEKING BALANCE / THE LIE COMFORTS / RISING TIDES</span>
        </li>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      As a result of the Plunder Will, the Kansas City Breath Mints preform Necromancy on Sutton Picklestein. However, Picklestein's Returned modification triggers immediately, sending them back to the Hall
    </li>
    <li>
      This season, the Trust will grants the modification <u>Uncertain</u>: When this player returns from Elsewhere, they'll be adjusted by -15% to +20%
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
      Two Postseason Births (Shadowed players granted to teams who play in the Postseason) disappear from their respective rosters: Tad Seeth of the Charleston Shoe Thieves and Brisket Friendo of the Kansas City Breath Mints
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Boss briefly appears, simply saying <span style="color: ede06d";>Where'd you go, Friendo?</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          The Commissioner Tweets, stating that a missing persons report had been filed, and saying that two investigators had been hired to look into the dissapearances
          <ul>
            <li>
              The investigators in question are theorized to be the two Hard Boiled ex-BC Noir players: Uncle Plasma and Liquid Friend
            </li>

                Fans decipher the messages, revealing "friends / no accident / was a setup / beware". This is theorized to be about the disappearance of Tad Seeth and Brisket Friendo
              </li>
