          A new weather type appears: Flooding. This occasionally causes a "surge of Immateria" to wash all current baserunners off of the bases. When this happens, it also occasionally sends a player Elsewhere, giving them the Elsewhere modification. A player who is Elsewhere is removed from play for an indefinite amount of time, having a chance to return to play during another game
          <ul>
            <li>
              <u>Elsewhere</u>: This player is Elsewhere. They'll find their own way back.

          After games conclude on Day 99, The Boss appears
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span style="color: #ede06d";>We made it! / What an incredible season! / Now, We want to assure everyone, / We have the Flooding issue under control. / We're looking into a number of fixes. / But no one wants to hear about that. / Who's ready for some exciteing ILB Postseason action? / It's party time!</span>

              <span style="color:  #ede06d";>Congratulations Hades Tigers! / Great news! / We have everything under control. / Thanks to Our swift action / Things seem to be levelling off. / Rejoice! / You can expect less Flooding in the Future! / Meanwhile Our Food and Beverage Director is busy cooking up new tasty treats. / And what an Election! / The Fans have spoken / And We answered. / Smooth sailing ahead.</span>

              The <u>Based Evolution</u> decree passes
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span style="color: white";>FROM NURSERY TO VAULT / PILLARS QUAKE / ACCRETION / FIRST STEPS / ROUNDING FIRST</span>

                    <li>
                      Rather than Ascending (cancelled after the Shelled One's defeat), teams that win three Championships will now Evolve. A team that "rounds the evolutionary bases" will go "Home"
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          The Hades Tigers gain the <u>Ambush</u> modification, and all of their Players gain Base 1 Evolution
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              <u>Ambush</u>: When a player is incinerated in a game this team is playing, a Hall of Flame player will join their Shadows.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>

              The first round of Wills passes, causing many Player swaps between teams. Two new Modifications come into play as well:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Players who benefit from the Trust Will receive the <u>Flippers</u> Modification
                  <ul>
                    <li><u>Flippers</u>: When immateria floods, this Runner will score instead of being cleared from the Bases.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pudge Nakamoto, who is targeted by the Revoke Will, receives the <u>Roamin'</u> Modification and moves to the Charleston Shoe Thieves
                  <ul>
                    <li><u>Roamin'</u>: This player has a chance of Roamin' to a new team at the end of each season.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The "The Big Sip" and "Uncle Indemnity" Blessings recruit two Coffee Cup-exclusive players from the BC Noir team to the San Francisco Lovers and New York Millennials respectively: Liquid Friend and Uncle Plasma. Both players have the <u>Hard Boiled</u> Modification
              <ul>
                <li><u>Hard Boiled</u>: This player was boiled a little bit before hatching</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        </li>
