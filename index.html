               Welcome to the new and improved Splortsmanship site, home to, well, not <i>all</i> things Blaseball, but definitely a good handful of them.

               More features incoming when I have the time/patience to get them set up.

               Hi, I'm Pigeon, and I'm not used to writing bios outside of the funny little Twitter ones.
               <br>
               <br>
               I started coding thanks to Blaseball, and this site is the byproduct of a frenzied night on w3schools that turned into a multi-month crash course in coding. This is also where I say thanks to everyone who has encouraged me since I picked this domain up back in... oh god, October? Somewhere around there? I would've quit a long time ago if not for y'all.
               <br>
               <br>
               Within the Blaseball community itself, I'm a rep for the Canada Moist Talkers (hi guys, it's me!) and a Custodian (have you tried a hard refresh and clearing your cache? That usually fixes the problem).
               <br>
               <br>
               I am not keeper_pigeons. I'm sorry, Pigeons, for all the cases of mistaken identity.
               <br>
               <br>
               You can find me yelling about Blaseball (and sometimes site updates or - rarely - the elusive <i>not Blaseball</i>) on my <a href="https://twitter.com/angrybookseller">Twitter</a>!
               <br>
               <br>
               If you're so inclined, you can also fuel a late-night coding session and help me with domain costs via my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/pigeon4242">Ko-fi</a>
