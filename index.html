               Welcome to the new and improved Splortsmanship site, home to, well, not <i>all</i> things Blaseball, but there's like, a guide.

               Hi, we're <a href="https://www.theflock.online/index.html">The Flock</a>, and we're not used to writing bios outside of the funny little Twitter ones.
               <br>
               <br>
               We started coding thanks to Blaseball, and this site is the byproduct of a frenzied night on w3schools that turned into a multi-month crash course in coding. This is also where we say thanks to everyone who has encouraged us since we picked this domain up back in... oh god, October? Somewhere around there? We would've quit a long time ago if not for y'all.
               <br>
               <br>
               Within the Blaseball community itself, we're reps for the Canada Moist Talkers (hi guys, it's us!) and Custodians (have you tried a hard refresh and clearing your cache? That usually fixes the problem).
               <br>
               <br>
               We not keeper_pigeons. I'm sorry, Pigeons, for all the cases of mistaken identity.
               <br>
               <br>
               You can find Pigeon yelling about Blaseball (and sometimes site updates or - rarely - the elusive <i>not Blaseball</i>) on his <a href="https://twitter.com/angrybookseller">Twitter</a>!
               <br>
               <br>
               If you're so inclined, you can also fuel a late-night coding session and help us with domain costs via our <a href="https://ko-fi.com/pigeon4242">Ko-fi</a>
