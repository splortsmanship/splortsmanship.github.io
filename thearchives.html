  You've found something secret! Well, not really, honestly. However, due to the ever-changing nature of Blaseball, some facets of the Guide were no longer applicable, but I wanted to keep them on hand - just in case.
  <br>
  <br>
  So, this may not be Forbidden Knowledge, but it might be confusing if you're just starting out, so I'd recommend that you wander on back to the <a href="guide.html">guide</a> before snooping around over here.

<h2 id="forgotten-weather">Forgotten Weather</h2>
<p>Baffling meteorologists everywhere, some types of weather in Blaseball have simply... stopped happening. We look back upon them here.</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Solar Eclipse</u>: During solar eclipses, rogue umpires will occasionally appear and incinerate one of the players on the field, killing them instantly and replacing them with a new, randomly generated player.</li>
  <li><u>Peanuts</u>: During peanut weather, peanuts fall from the sky. A couple of things can happen here. Players have a chance of accidentally swallowing a falling peanut, and many have peanut allergies as per a randomly generated stat. If they&#39;re allergic, they&#39;ll have an allergic reaction, and their stats will decrease. If they&#39;re not, they&#39;ll have a yummy reaction, and their stats will increase. Occasionally &quot;Big Peanuts&quot; will crash into the field, and these have a chance of encasing a player inside a giant peanut shell, removing them from the batting lineup/pitching rotation, but not from the team (unless the Shelled One keeps stealing them - more on that later).</li>
  <li><u>Too Many Birds</u>: During this weather, the birds may peck a shelled player free, or mob a batter, forcing them to flee and causing an out.</li>
  <li><u>Feedback</u>: During Feed back weather, two players on opposing teams will occasionally swap.</li>
  <li><u>Reverb</u>: During Reverb weather, teams will occasionally shuffle around. No players will leave your team, but your batting lineup or pitching rotation might get reorganized. The two may also get shuffled together, meaning that a pitcher becomes a batter and vice versa. Occasionally a single player will be affected by this weather type and gain a modifier that causes them to have a chance of batting twice during each at bat during other instances of this same weather type.</li>
  <li><u>Blooddrain</u>: During the Blooddrain, players may steal blood from each other. This means that the player doing the draining gains some of the drained player&#39;s ability in batting, pitching, baserunning, or defense, leaving that drained player weakened permanently. </li>
</ul>

  These were important, at one time. Now? Not so much. But it doesn't hurt to remember...

<p>This is very new to the community as a whole, but worth giving a brief overview of for the new folks, because it has become a very prominent facet of the game. Remember that Shelled One I mentioned earlier? Long story short, we&#39;ve really ticked it off, and it stole all of the players that were trapped in peanut shells (some escaped, but not many) at the end of Season Nine. After the finals that season, the champions - The Charleston Shoe Thieves - had to face off against it in a boss fight reminiscent of JRPGs, a Blaseball game replacing standard combat. They lost, but we&#39;re certain that it will happen again. Be ready to work with both your team and the community at large to prepare.</p>
