          <p>
            Canadians find themselves building ever upward as the Canadian floodwaters grow ever deeper with no sign of receding. The country's infrastructure has begun to shape itself around what the Public Figures are calling "the new norm", with boardwalks and sea taxis quickly taking the place of sidewalks and cars. Herald correspondents attempted to reach out to the Corporate Entities responsible for these new developments, but were unable to find the groups responsible.

            Prime Minister <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> has asked citizens to stay calm, and said to enjoy their "exciting new amphibious lifestyles." This announcement has prompted many Canadians to look in the mirror and ask themselves why something feels off, if something about them has <em>changed</em>.

          <p>
            To much fanfare, the Gleek Arena has appeared in central Halifax! Often described as "immaterial" and "impossible to find unless it wants you to find it", The Gleek boasts seating for <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> patrons, and a tremendously affordable Season Pass program.

          <p>
            Stadium staff, when asked to comment on the disappearance of several stadium patrons into the yawning mouth in the centre of the field known as THE MAW, responded with a series of gurgles and a creeping sense of unease. Our correspondent in the Gleek (who, to our knowledge, cannot and will not ever leave the Arena) refused to re-enter the depths of its labyrinthine Underarena to request further information.
