<ul>
<li>Before the results of the Season Ten election are revealed, The Monitor appears<ul>
  <li><span style="color:#5988ff";>hey / Boss is here / she&#39;ll be right with you / oh here she is</span><ul>
<li>As The Monitor speaks, to messages repeat on loop across the ticker<ul>
<li>THE COMMISSIONER IS DOING A GREAT JOB</li>
<li>WHERE DID THE CRABS GO?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A &quot;please wait...&quot; message dominates the screen beneath the ticker</li>
<li>An image of what appears to be an Ancient Greek coin appears and begins to speak. Currently, as per the official records supplied by the Discord, she is titled ???<ul>
  <li><span style="color:#ede06d";>If We could have everyone&#39;s attention. / We are so thrilled to have done this Deal. / We&#39;re fans, just like you. / But We&#39;re not going to lie to you. / Blaseball is a mess. / It&#39;s been unfair. / And that upsets Us. / Discipline was the Past / Fair Play is the Future. / And that Future begins right now. / A Grand Siesta will follow Season 11. / We&#39;re going to finally start Investing in Blaseball. / We&#39;re going to Build. / We&#39;ll be working directly with our new CEO Parker MacMillan III. / We&#39;re all extremely proud of the work he&#39;s done. / It&#39;s the Dawn of a whole new Era.</span><ul>
<li>Parker MacMillan III is the name of the individual who was the interim Blaseball Commissioner, but now appears to have received a promotion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="season-ten-election">Season Ten Election</h3>
<ul>
<li>Several announcements are released alongside the Election results<ul>
<li>The Baltimore Crabs have been Called Up. Good Luck on your Journey! They shall be replaced in the ILB with the Tokyo Lift.<ul>
<li>The Baltimore Crabs are removed from the game, and replaced by the Tokyo Lift, with all new players (with the exception of Wyatt Quitter, see below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Shelled One&#39;s Pods have fallen back to the plane!<ul>
<li>The players from the Pods are redistributed at random to teams in the League, with no one team getting more than one new player. These players are added to their rosters without removing preexisting players.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Deal is complete.<ul>
<li>Players from the Hall Stars team are stated to have been &quot;Released&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
  <li>The Black Hole decree is enacted. This introduces two new weather types: Black Hole and Sun 2</li><ul>
  <li><u>Black Hole</u>: Whenever a team scores 10 runs in a game, that team's score is brought back to zero, but the Black Hole removes a win from the opposing team</li>
  <li><u>Sun 2</u>: Whenever a team scores 10 runs in a game, the team's score is brought back to zero and Sun 2 grants them a bonus win</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>All teams now have the Total Fairness modifier<ul>
<li><u>Total Fairness</u>: Each team will win only one Blessing, and will be Happy with what they get.<ul>
<li>This blessing is Seasonal, and looks like it will apply to Season Eleven election results</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Microphone begins to Tweet<ul>
  <li><span style="color:#FF00FF";>Jaylen / hi / we did it / they&#39;re free / what do we do now? / wait where are the Crabs?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="season-eleven">Season Eleven</h2>
<ul>
<li>Black Hole and Sun 2 begin to affect games, playing havoc with win rates: one team may be recorded as having played many more or less games than another due to the addition/removal of wins. This also allows team statistics to be calculated using a metric of wins per win.<ul>
<li>The main season is relatively uneventful due to the lack of other weather</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Telescope appears on the Bulletin page of the main site, displaying a win-loss count. The existence of blaseball2.com is discovered, which hosts an image of the Baltimore Crabs logo behind a gate, surrounded by clouds. Clicking one of the clouds reveals The 1-Blood Blagonball. General assumption is that the Crabs are playing Blaseball against an unknown opponent in (via the Comissioner&#39;s Twitter) &quot;the Big Leagues&quot;.</li>
<li>The Hellmouth Sunbeams claim their first championship title<ul>
<li>??? (now titled The Coin) appears after the season concludes<ul>
<li><span style="color:#ede06d";>Congratulations Hellmouth Sunbeams! / You&#39;re winners! /We&#39;re all winners! / And this is just the Beginning! / We see you. / We hear you. / You deserve a say. / It&#39;s only Fair. /Tomorrow, we write the Future. / Together.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="season-eleven-election">Season Eleven Election</h3>
<ul>
<li>This Season&#39;s Decrees - three of which go into effect - all follow the same format: ...[Action]! The Forbidden Book...<ul>
<li>The three that pass are Eat!, Deface!, and Close! <ul>
<li>...Eat! The Forbidden Book...<ul>
<li>The Book Eats / Everything in Sight. / Stomachs Rumble. / Concessions are Made.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>...Deface! The Forbidden Book...<ul>
<li>The Book Defaces / Itself. / It Rewrites the Rules, / Re-faces the Ballot. / Regards Itself. / Recognizes Your Will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>...Close! The Forbidden Book...<ul>
<li>The Book Closes / On a Prime Piece of Property in Baltimore. / Peanut Debris is Cleared. / Ground is Broken on the Crabitat.<ul>
<li>&quot;The Crabitat&quot; is the fan-chosen name for the Baltimore Crabs&#39; stadium</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This Season&#39;s Blessings take the form of Tarot cards, and have no descriptions. Each team wins one, a team being removed from the running once they had received a card. These cards have no clear effects yet, but have been listed on the team&#39;s pages. Winners are as follows:<ul>
<li>I - The Magician: Yellowstone Magic</li>
<li>II - The High Priestess: Hawai&#39;i Fridays</li>
<li>III - The Empress: Boston Flowers</li>
<li>IIII - The Emperor: Dallas Steaks</li>
<li>V - The Hierophant: Canada Moist Talkers</li>
<li>VI - The Lover: New York Millenials</li>
<li>VII - The Chariot: Unlimited Tacos</li>
<li>VIII - Justice: Seattle Garages</li>
<li>VIIII - The Hermit: Philly Pies</li>
<li>X - The Wheel of Fortune: Charleston Shoe Thieves</li>
<li>XI - Strength: Tokyo Lift</li>
<li>XII  - The Hanged Man: Hellmouth Sunbeams</li>
<li>XIII - The Kansas City Breath Mints<ul>
<li>XIII is, technically speaking, the &quot;Death&quot; card, but is left untitled in the Marseilles Tarot, which is the deck referenced in the Blessings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>XIIII - Temperance: Chicago Firefighters</li>
<li>XV - The Devil: Hades Tigers</li>
<li>XVI - The Tower: Breckenridge Jazz Hands</li>
<li>XVII - The Star: Miami Dale</li>
<li>XVIII - The Moon: Houston Spies</li>
<li>XVIIII - The Sun: Mexico City Wild Wings</li>
<li>XX - Judgement: San Francisco Lovers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grand-siesta">Grand Siesta</h2>
<ul>
<li>Blaseball enters a Grand Siesta, the duration of which is unspecified. However, due to the nature of the community, the break is not as restful as one would assume, and several events occur therein:<ul>
<li>The Court Case/Death of Parker MacMillan III<ul>
<li>In the Blaseball Discord, judge_keeper_sins holds court for three separate trials, though the main focus is on the Mills v Macmillan III:<ul>
<li>The Mills v. MacMillan III: On behalf of the 99%, the New York Millennials sue the Commissioner (and, by proxy, the Boss), for failing to redistribute wealth for the past two seasons according to the &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; Decree<ul>
<li>VERDICT: The Coin is found guilty, but MacMillan II is innocent. The coins owed will be distributed, to a degree, to the 99% via an increase to passive income. However, despite his innocence being declared, MacMillan III had been incinerated by ump_admin_pope_sunman (whose name evolved to include the admin title during the Wiki Team&#39;s case, see below) before the trial&#39;s end. The &quot;simulation&quot; of the Commissioner went rogue, and MacMillan III was promptly replaced by MacMillan IIII<ul>
<li>Several in-game effects are applied as a result of events within the trial: Thomas Dracaena of the New York Millennials is to be given additional baserunning, as the court wants to &quot;see more data crimes.&quot; For her legal counsel, Beans McBlase of the Canada Moist Talkers is to be given additional baserunning as well. Lawyer Case Sports is to be reinstated to the Mexico City Wild Wings lineup, having been sent to the Shadows at the end of Season 9 due to the Disappearing Acts Blessing. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Firefighters v. Dr. Mr. U. P. Q. Sunman, Ph.D, JD, esq.: The Firefighters sue ump_pope_sunman for Incinerating all three of their chats and the users therein for referring to sunman as &quot;Ump Poop Sunman&quot;</li>
<li>Wiki Team v. Dr. Mr. U. P. Q. Sunman, Ph.D, JD, esq.: The Wiki Team sues ump_pope_sunman for his hand in making their jobs extremely difficult - events such as the Wyatt Masoning, The Mexico City Wild Wings naming debacle, and frequent Incinerations  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>The <a href="coffeecup.html">Coffee Cup</a> is announced, which redistributes active players into new, temporary teams based on their coffee preference. Three bonus teams flesh out the roster as well: SIBR&#39;s team, the Data Witches, and the fanart community&#39;s team, the Pandemonium Artists. The third team is left unannounced. Games will occur on Tuesdays.</li>
