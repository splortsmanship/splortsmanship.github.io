            I love horror, but horror sucks about a lot of things. As a queer, neurodiverse horror fan, I've struggled to find horror that doesn't misrepresent almost everything I am, and twist it into something for people to be afraid of.
            <br>
            <br>
            So I started a list.
            <br>
            <br>
            I cannot - and will not claim to - speak for everyone in every demographic. I've tried to do my due diligence and research what I could, but being human, it's altogether possible (likely, even) that I've missed things or made mistakes. If you see something that you feel should not have made the cut, please feel free to give me a shout (see the sidebar for contact info).
            <br>
            <br>
            A couple of notes going in:
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>On content warnings:</strong> I've tried to include content warnings for the media listed here. Please be aware that some pieces of media on this list may deal with potentially triggering subjects! Horror can be an excellent medium for discussing difficult subjects, but those subjects have to be addressed with respect rather than glamourized - I've tried to choose horror that does the former. Additionally, some of the content warnings will be spoilers. I've attempted to keep things vague, however I firmly believe that safety takes priority over totally spoiler-free presentation.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>On stepping away from media:</strong> Horror is designed to be uncomfortable, but should not be so upsetting as to be a bad experience. There is no weakness in not finishing something that is actively causing you distress, and don't let sunk cost fallacy convince you to partake in a piece of media that is no longer enjoyable. Your wellbeing should always, always come first.
