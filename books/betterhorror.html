            I love horror, but horror sucks about a lot of things. As a queer, neurodiverse horror fan, I've struggled to find horror that doesn't misrepresent almost everything I am, and twist it into something for people to be afraid of.
            <br>
            <br>
            So I started a list.
            <br>
            <br>
            I cannot - and will not claim to - speak for everyone in every demographic. I've tried to do my due diligence and research what I could, but being human, it's altogether possible (likely, even) that I've missed things or made mistakes. If you see something that you feel should not have made the cut, please feel free to give me a shout (see the sidebar for contact info).
